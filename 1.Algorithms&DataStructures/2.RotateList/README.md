### Rotate Linked List

You should add to your previous implementation of LinkedList one more method: "rotate" which should rotate list by 'n' places, where n is non negative.

### Note:
- Cover your implementation by Unit Tests (you can use any Library for that).

Example 1:
```
Input: 0->1->2->3->4, n = 2
Output: 3->4->0->1->2
Explanation:
1 steps to the right: 4->0->1->2->3
2 steps to the right: 3->4->0->1->2
``` 

Example 2:
```
Input: 1->2->3, n = 3
Output: 1->2->3
Explanation:
1 steps to the right: 3->1->2
2 steps to the right: 2->3->1
3 steps to the right: 1->2->3
```
