### Convert Array To Tree
Given an array where elements are not sorted, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

### Note
- Your are not allowed to use built-in sort functions. If you need sort array you should develop your own implementation.
- Cover your implementation by Unit Tests (you can use any Library for that).


#### Example

```
Given the sorted array: [-3 -9, 4, 0, 9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-9,null,4], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -9  4
```
